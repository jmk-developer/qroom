# Client
The client-side application was written in MIT App Inventor. I have linked the project file in this directory. Find the built APK in the Releases section.
### Warning
By default, this application uses my Glitch hosted version of the server. You won't be able to do much with this on your own.
To set up your own server, go to the /server directory.
